// When we originally made the chat function for MUnchMates, we used a cocoapod called JSQMessages. The cocoapod did not work well, so we decided to make our own messaging view controller. This bride is now pointless bc we are not using JSQMessages, however, deleting might cause issues, so we didn't bother trying to delete the bridge.
